Game of Thrones,10,4,
House Of The Dragon,9.4,3,"They made the Blond Haired Purple Eyed Velaryon household black, completely against all logic, and source material, also lots of super wahman and moaning about inequality, doesn't kills it but really takes the shine off an otherwise great show, how has GRRM not got the Capital to insist they keep this nonsense out his shows"

The Shield,9.31,5,
Homeland,9.3,5,"Despite the strong female lead that would instantly ruin a show in 2023 this actually makes the shows star Carrie a real person with, massive geunine flaws and a unique heros journey, one of the last great female characters on the small screen"
Peaky Blinders,9.3,5,
1923,9.3,5,

Mindhunter,9.1,4,season 2 was particularly tedious playing up the racial inequalities to farcial unrealistic levels
Handmaids Tale,9.1,4,"Just a 4 nearly a 3 lots of nonsense but it all mostly fits and works and I would say is a great adaptation of a great book and the recently released sequel the Testaments, If they made this starting today 19/20 times it would be garbage this is definately the 1, you still need to give them some rope to explore the characters but it's worth it"

Bosch: Legacy,9,3,
Reacher,9,2,"They ruined reacher, utterly ridiculous female characters like 1 tiny accountant wahman hand to hand combat killing 5 bikers then fixing her hair and makeup like it's nothing, extensive wokeness compounded byawful writing and filming.
